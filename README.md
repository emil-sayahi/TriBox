# TriBox
Experimentation with Meshomatic.

This was a rendering program that was intended to be a game engine using OpenGL, written in C#, based on a collection of model loader classes called Meshomatic. It could load basic .OBJ models. Mainly what I managed to accomplish with this was loading in different kinds of models and rotating them.
